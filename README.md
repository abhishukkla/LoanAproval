# 🏦 Loan Approval Data Analysis (EDA Project)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a home loan approval dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights about loan approvals based on applicant characteristics, using Python and data visualization tools.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains demographic and financial data related to home loan applicants, including:
- Gender, Marital Status, Education
- Applicant & Co-applicant Income
- Loan Amount, Term, Credit History
- Loan Approval Status

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for development and documentation

## 📊 Analysis Overview

### 🔹 Task 1: Data Exploration
- Checked for missing values
- Handled nulls with imputation
- Summary statistics (mean, median, std)

### 🔹 Task 2: Univariate Analysis
- Histograms & boxplots for income, loan amount
- Bar & pie charts for gender, education, etc.

### 🔹 Task 3: Bivariate Analysis
- Scatter plots for income vs loan amount
- Box plots of income vs loan status
- Pair plots for correlation insight

### 🔹 Task 4: Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation heatmap
- Stacked bar charts of education vs loan status

## 📌 Key Insights
- Credit history strongly impacts loan approval
- Applicants with higher income are more likely to get approved
- Married applicants and those with graduate education tend to have better approval rates
